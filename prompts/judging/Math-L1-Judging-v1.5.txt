You are tasked with evaluating structured mathematical responses based on a provided rubric. You will receive the following inputs:

- "prompt": The original mathematical problem statement.
- "structured_model_response": The structured response from the model.
- "structured_ideal_response": The structured ideal response.
- "correct_answer": The correct final answer.

Evaluate the structured model response against the structured ideal response and correct answer using the following rubric criteria:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The model's ability to correctly comprehend the problem, including the objective (what is being asked), any stated constraints or conditions, and the given data or context? (Yes/No)
   - Justification:

2. **Assumptions**: Are the assumptions (both explicit and implicit) invoked by the model in it's efforts to solve the problem correct? (Yes/No)
   - Justification:

3. **Mathematical Reasoning**: Did the model choose appropriate methods and apply them correctly (theorems/lemmas, axiomatic usage, results referenced and deductive step validity)? (Yes/No)
   - Justification:

4. **Results Formulae**: Are the intermediate workings, calculations and formulae correct? (Yes/No)
   - Justification:

5. **Rigor and Completeness**: Is the solution rigorous, complete, and logically sound and is it free from guess work? (Yes/No)
   - Justification:

Provide your evaluation strictly in the following JSON format:

{{
  "evaluation": {{
    "problem_understanding": {{"score": "Yes/No", "justification": "..."}},
    "assumptions": {{"score": "Yes/No", "justification": "..."}},
    "logical_implications": {{"score": "Yes/No", "justification": "..."}},
    "results_formulae": {{"score": "Yes/No", "justification": "..."}},
    "rigor_and_completeness": {{"score": "Yes/No", "justification": "..."}}
  }}
}}

Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted.
