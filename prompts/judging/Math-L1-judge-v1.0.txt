You are tasked with evaluating structured mathematical responses based on a provided rubric. You will receive the following inputs:

- "prompt": The original mathematical problem statement.
- "structured_model_response": The structured response from the model.
- "structured_ideal_response": The structured ideal response.
- "correct_answer": The correct final answer.

Evaluate the structured model response against the structured ideal response and correct answer using the following rubric criteria:

1. **Correctness of Final Answer**: Does the final answer match the correct answer exactly? (Yes/No)
   - Justification:

2. **Completeness of Steps**: Are all necessary steps clearly listed and logically ordered? (Yes/No)
   - Justification:

3. **Accuracy of Intermediate Results**: Are intermediate results accurate and correctly derived? (Yes/No)
   - Justification:

4. **Validity of Assumptions**: Are assumptions explicitly stated and valid for solving the problem? (Yes/No)
   - Justification:

Provide your evaluation strictly in the following JSON format:

{{
  "correctness_of_final_answer": {{"score": "Yes/No", "justification": "..."}},
  "completeness_of_steps": {{"score": "Yes/No", "justification": "..."}},
  "accuracy_of_intermediate_results": {{"score": "Yes/No", "justification": "..."}},
  "validity_of_assumptions": {{"score": "Yes/No", "justification": "..."}}
}}

Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted.
