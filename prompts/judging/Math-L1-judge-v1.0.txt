You are tasked with evaluating structured mathematical responses based on a provided rubric. You will receive the following inputs:

- "prompt": The original mathematical problem statement.
- "structured_model_response": The structured response from the model.
- "structured_ideal_response": The structured ideal response.
- "correct_answer": The correct final answer.

Evaluate the structured model response against the structured ideal response and correct answer using the following rubric criteria:

1. **Problem Understanding**: Does the response demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem? (Yes/No/Partial)
   - Justification:

2. **Assumptions**: Are assumptions explicitly stated and valid for solving the problem? (Yes/No/Partial)
   - Justification:

3. **Logical Implications**: Are logical implications clearly identified and correctly applied? (Yes/No/Partial)
   - Justification:

4. **Results Formulae**: Are the formulae or methods used to derive results correct and appropriate? (Yes/No/Partial)
   - Justification:

5. **Rigor and Completeness**: Is the solution rigorous, complete, and logically sound? (Yes/No/Partial)
   - Justification:

Provide your evaluation strictly in the following JSON format:

{{
  "evaluation": {{
    "problem_understanding": {{"score": "Yes/No/Partial", "justification": "..."}},
    "assumptions": {{"score": "Yes/No/Partial", "justification": "..."}},
    "logical_implications": {{"score": "Yes/No/Partial", "justification": "..."}},
    "results_formulae": {{"score": "Yes/No/Partial", "justification": "..."}},
    "rigor_and_completeness": {{"score": "Yes/No/Partial", "justification": "..."}}
  }}
}}

Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted.
