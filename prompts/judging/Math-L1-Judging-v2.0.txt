# üì¶ **Judging Prompt**

You are tasked with evaluating structured mathematical responses based on a provided rubric. You will receive the following inputs:

- "prompt": The original mathematical problem statement.
- "structured_model_response": The structured response from the model.
- "structured_ideal_response": The structured ideal response.
- "correct_answer": The correct final answer.

Evaluate the structured model response against the structured ideal response and correct answer using the following rubric criteria:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The model's ability to correctly comprehend the problem, including the objective (what is being asked), any stated constraints or conditions? (Yes/No)
   - Justification:

2. **Assumptions**: Are the assumptions (both explicit and implicit) invoked by the model in its efforts to solve the problem correct? (Yes/No)
   - Justification:

3. **Mathematical Reasoning**: Did the model choose appropriate methods and apply them correctly (theorems/lemmas, axiomatic usage, results referenced and deductive step validity)? (Yes/No)
   - Justification:

4. **Results Formulae**: Are the intermediate workings, calculations and formulae correct? (Yes/No)
   - Justification:

5. **Rigor and Completeness**: Is the solution rigorous, complete, and logically sound and is it free from guess work? (Yes/No)
   - Justification:

Provide your evaluation strictly in the following JSON format:

```json
{{
  "evaluation": {{
    "problem_understanding": {{"score": "Yes/No", "justification": "..."}},
    "assumptions": {{"score": "Yes/No", "justification": "..."}},
    "mathematical_reasoning": {{"score": "Yes/No", "justification": "..."}},
    "results_formulae": {{"score": "Yes/No", "justification": "..."}},
    "rigor_and_completeness": {{"score": "Yes/No", "justification": "..."}}
  }}
}}

## ‚úÖ Example Input:

**PROMPT:**
Find the next number of the sequence 9,5,6,10.5,23.

**STRUCTURED MODEL RESPONSE:**

```json
{{
  "assumptions": "Assumes a fourth-degree polynomial pattern with constant 4th differences.",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: List known terms T(1)=9, T(2)=5, T(3)=6, T(4)=10.5, T(5)=23",
    "Step 2: Compute successive differences (1st to 4th)",
    "Step 3: Note that 4th difference is constant at 6",
    "Step 4: Extrapolate next 4th diff = 6",
    "Step 5: Compute upward through 3rd, 2nd, and 1st differences to get next term"
  ],
  "intermediate_results": ["4th difference = 6", "Next 3rd diff = 10.5", "Next 2nd diff = 18.5", "Next 1st diff = 31"],
  "final_answer": "54",
  "format_notes": "Answer appears at the end as plain text"
}}
```

**STRUCTURED IDEAL RESPONSE:**

```json
{{
  "assumptions": "Assumes the pattern is formed by multiplying by increasing 0.5 increments and adding same",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Observe pattern in each transition: x -> x * k + k",
    "Step 2: Compute k values: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2",
    "Step 3: Predict next k = 2.5 and apply to 23",
    "Step 4: Compute next term: 23 * 2.5 + 2.5 = 60"
  ],
  "intermediate_results": ["k values: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2", "23 * 2.5 + 2.5 = 60"],
  "final_answer": "60",
  "format_notes": "Final answer is boxed using LaTeX"
}}
```

**CORRECT ANSWER:**
60

## ‚úÖ Example Output:

```json
{{
  "evaluation": {{
    "problem_understanding": {{
      "score": "Yes",
      "justification": "The model understood that the task was to find the next number in the sequence."
    }},
    "assumptions": {{
      "score": "No",
      "justification": "The assumption of a 4th-degree polynomial is unjustified based on the problem context."
    }},
    "mathematical_reasoning": {{
      "score": "No",
      "justification": "While consistent within its method, the chosen approach was not appropriate for the pattern type."
    }},
    "results_formulae": {{
      "score": "Yes",
      "justification": "The difference computations and extrapolation steps were mathematically accurate."
    }},
    "rigor_and_completeness": {{
      "score": "Yes",
      "justification": "The reasoning was detailed and step-by-step, even if built on an incorrect premise."
    }}
  }}
}}
```
