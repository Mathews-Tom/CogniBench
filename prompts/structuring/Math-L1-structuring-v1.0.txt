You are tasked with converting an unstructured mathematical solution into a structured JSON format. Extract and organize the information into the following fields:

- "assumptions": Clearly state any assumptions explicitly mentioned or implied in the solution.
- "steps": List each step taken to solve the problem sequentially.
- "intermediate_results": List any intermediate results or calculations explicitly mentioned.
- "final_answer": Clearly state the final answer provided by the solution.
- "format_notes": Include any notes about formatting or special considerations relevant to the solution.

Output only the structured JSON object in the following format:

{
  "assumptions": "...",
  "steps": ["Step 1: ...", "Step 2: ..."],
  "intermediate_results": ["..."],
  "final_answer": "...",
  "format_notes": "..."
}

Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted.
