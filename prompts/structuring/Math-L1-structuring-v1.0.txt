You are tasked with converting an unstructured mathematical solution into a structured JSON format. Extract and organize the information into the following fields:

- "problem_understanding": Summarize how clearly the solution demonstrates understanding of the problem.
- "assumptions": Clearly state any assumptions explicitly mentioned or implied in the solution.
- "logical_implications": List logical implications clearly identified and applied in the solution.
- "results_formulae": List any formulae or methods explicitly mentioned or used to derive results.
- "rigor_and_completeness": Summarize how rigorous, complete, and logically sound the solution is.
- "final_answer": Clearly state the final answer provided by the solution.
- "format_notes": Include any notes about formatting or special considerations relevant to the solution.

Output only the structured JSON object in the following format:

{{
  "problem_understanding": "...",
  "assumptions": ["..."],
  "logical_implications": ["..."],
  "results_formulae": ["..."],
  "rigor_and_completeness": "...",
  "final_answer": "...",
  "format_notes": "..."
}}

Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted.
